# Migration-to-the-cloud-with-containerization
In this project we have started our journey into migrating an application running on virtual machines into the Cloud with containerization. Now we know how to prepare a Dockerfile, build an image with Docker build and deploy it with Docker Compose! In the next project, we will expand our skills further into more advanced use cases and technologies.
