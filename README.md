In this project, we are migrating an application that currently runs on virtual machines to the cloud using containerization.

**Key Tasks are**

1. Prepare a Dockerfile
2. Build an image using docker build
3. Deploy the application with Docker Compose
This migration process will enhance our understanding of containerization principles.

**Docker and Cloud Containerization**

**Docker** is a cloud-native platform that enables you to build, run, and share containerized applications through a process known as dockerization. This involves creating Dockerfiles, which package all the necessary software to run an application into a portable and executable Docker image.

**Cloud Containerization**
Cloud containers serve as a virtual home for software. They operate on top of an operating system (OS) and rely on a comprehensive setup that defines the OS and the number of containers required. By abstracting the underlying OS, containers allow developers to focus solely on the application itself. This abstraction is what makes containers particularly attractive for modern software deployment.
